Before writing the code ....
It's important to understand who your target audience
is, why they would come to your site, what information
they want to find and when they are likely to return, So you have to answer these questions before you start writing the code :


**Who is the Site For?**

**Why People Visit**
YOUR Website :
Every website should be designed for the
target audience—not just for yourself or the
site owner. It is therefore very important to
understand who your target audience is.

**What Your Visitors are Trying to Achieve :**
Now that you know who your visitors are, you
need to consider why they are coming. While
some people will simply chance across your
website, most will visit for a specific reason.


**What Information Your Visitors Need**
You know who is coming to your site and why
they are coming, so now you need to work out
what information they need in order to achieve
their goals quickly and effectively

**How Often People Will**
Visit Your Site
Some sites benefit from being updated more
frequently than others. Some information (such
as news) may be constantly changing, while
other content remains relatively static.

**After you have determined your goal of building the website, you must build the website properly and in an orderly way, by using:** 
**Site Maps**
Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site.
Site Maps : Now that you know what needs to appear
on your site, you can start to organize the
information into sections or pages.

**WireFrames :**
Wireframes allow you to organize the information that
will need to go on each page.
 A wireframe is a simple sketch of the key
information that needs to go on each page of a
site. It shows the hierarchy of the information
and how much space it might require.

**Getting your message across using design :**
The primary aim of any kind of visual design
is to communicate. Organizing and prioritizing
information on a page helps users understand
its importance and what order to read it in.



**Visual hierarchy :** 
Most web users do not read entire pages. Rather, they skim to find
information. You can use contrast to create a visual hierarchy that gets
across your key message and helps users find what they are looking for.

**grouping and Similarity :** When making sense of a design, we tend to organize visual elements
into groups. Grouping related pieces of information together can make a
design easier to comprehend. Here are some ways this can be achieved.

**Designing Navigation :**
 Site navigation not only helps people find where they want to go, but also
helps them understand what your site is about and how it is organized.
Good navigation tends to follow these principles : Concise – Clear – Selective – Context – Interactive – Consistent .





## There are three main elements that make up an HTML page :

**body**
You met the <body> element
in the first example we created.
Everything inside this element is
shown inside the main browser
window.

**head**

Before the <body> element you
will often see a <head> element.
This contains information
about the page (rather than
information that is shown within
the main part of the browser
window that is highlighted in
blue on the opposite page).
You will usually find a <title>
element inside the <head>
element.

**title**

The contents of the <title>
element are either shown in the
top of the browser, above where
you usually type in the URL of
the page you want to visit, or
on the tab for that page (if your
browser uses tabs to allow you
to view multiple pages at the
same time).

## Tags :

Tags are often referred to as elements.
XX Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes
the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes
the end.
XX Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more
about the content of that element.
